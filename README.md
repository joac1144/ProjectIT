# ProjectIT

ProjectIT is a web platform built to show a concept that enhances the process of finding a project and supervisor for larger projects. It streamlines the process by having one centralized place for students and supervisors to match and connect.

The platform allows supervisors to propose and manage thesis topics, while students can browse, filter, and apply for projects—similar to applying for jobs online.

## Motivation

Every year, students at ITU face the same challenge: how to efficiently find the right supervisor and project for their final thesis. The process is often messy—spread across emails, informal conversations, and scattered documents. We saw this as an opportunity to build something meaningful: a digital platform that not only organizes the process but also improves the quality of matches between students and supervisors.

We built ProjectIT because we believe that the final thesis should start with inspiration, not frustration. By creating a centralized platform, we wanted to make the experience smoother, more transparent, and ultimately more rewarding for both students and supervisors.
